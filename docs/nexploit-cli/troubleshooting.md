### Repeater

More info about how the Repeater works and when to use one can be found here [Deployment Options > On-prem Agent (Repeater)](deployment/repeater.md)

#### Connectivity test

In order to user a Repeater from within a closed network, you must fist make sure it has the proper access between all the components of the scan.
You can use the `nexploit-cli configure` command to open a simple connectivity testing process.

> [!NOTE|label:Prerequisites]
> - The machine on which the Repeater will run, must have the latest version of [NexPloit CLI installed](nexploit-cli/installation.md)
> - A valid `AUTH_TOKEN` with the scope: `repeaters:write`, `scans:run`, `scans:read`, `scans:stop`
>   - You can set up an [Organization level Authentication Token](user-guide/organization-administration/details-and-policies.md#managing-organization-api-keys)
>   - Or, a [User level Authentication Token](user-guide/personal-account-administration/details-and-settings.md#managing-your-api-keys)
> - An active `REPEATER_ID`
>  - More info about [Setting up a New Repeater](user-guide/agents/overview.md)

##### Step-by-step Guide

1. Run the command `nexploit-cli configure` in your terminal, you should get the following output:

  ```bash
  Please browse to http://localhost:3000 to begin the configurations of the Repeater
  ```
  !> **Note:** If `http://localhost:3000` is already in use, a different port will be selected automatically.

2. Go to `http://localhost:3000` (or any other port that was used by the configure command), the configuration page will open in your local browser.

3. Fill out the `Auth Token` and `Repeater ID` details and click on **Next**.

4. The CLI will run the first stage of diagnostics:

  - **Connection to amq.nexploit.app at port 5672** is required for the Repeater to reach the scan engine
  - **Connection to nexploit.app at port 443** is required to reach our API endpoints
  - **Token and Repeater ID** are validated to be active

  If any of the validations fail, instructions on how to solve the problem will appear in the progress section below

5. After all the validations have passed, click on **Next**

  ![nexploit-cli-configure4](media/nexploit-cli-configure4.png ':size=40%')

6. Fill out the `Target URL` info and click on **Start Scan**, this step will validate the the current machine has access to the target application.

  !> **Note**: This will create a new scan, but it will not perform any active attack scenarios, the only test that will run is a passive security header check on the target application

7. After the connection to the target application was validated successfully, click on **Next**

8. That's it, you have completed all the connectivity validations, you can see the demo scan in the UI by clicking on the link https://nexploit.app/scans
