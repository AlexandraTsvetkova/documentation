# 🛠️ Installation
Before you can use **NexPloit CLI** make sure you have the following:
- An active user on www.nexploit.app
- A valid `REPEATER-TOKEN`
  - For the quick start these scopes are required: `agents:write:repeater`, `scans:run` and `scans:read`
  - More info about [setting up an API key](../user-guide/organization-administration/details-and-policies#managing-organization-api-keys)
- An active `REPEATER-ID`
  - More info about [Setting up a New Repeater](user-guide/agents/overview.md)

## Via npm
To install the CLI using the npm package manager, use the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @neuralegion/nexploit-cli
```

!> Major versions of NexPloit CLI follow the supported major version of NexPloit. For full details about changes between versions and release notes can be found here: https://github.com/NeuraLegion/nexploit-cli/releases

More info on our **npm** page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neuralegion/nexploit-cli

## Via Docker
To install the **Repeater**, you must have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

1. Pull the **Repeater Docker** using the command:
```
docker pull neuralegion/repeater
```
2. Create a new `REPEATER-TOKEN` with the scope `agents:write:repeater`
 - You can set up an [Organization level API Key](user-guide/organization-administration/details-and-policies.md#managing-organization-api-keys)
 - Or, a [User level API Key](user-guide/personal-account-administration/details-and-settings.md#managing-your-api-keys)

3. Set up a [New Repeater](user-guide/agents/overview.md) to create a new `REPEATER-ID`

4. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  target.local:
    image: path/image-name
  repeater:
    image: neuralegion/repeater:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      REPEATER_TOKEN: REPEATER-TOKEN # from step 2
      REPEATER_ID: REPEATER-ID # from step 3
```

5. Install the **Repeater Docker** by running the command
```
docker-compose up
```

!> **Note**: If did not add a valid `REPEATER-TOKEN` and `REPEATER-ID` you will get the following error: `repeater_1 | Unhandled exception in spawn: 403 - ACCESS_REFUSED - Login was refused using authentication mechanism PLAIN. For details see the broker logfile. (AMQP::Client::Connection::ClosedException)`

6. Now, when [Starting a New Scan](user-guide/scans/new-scan), you can connect the Repeater under [Addition Settings](user-guide/scans/new-scan#additional-settings) in the UI or use the CLI to start a scan.
