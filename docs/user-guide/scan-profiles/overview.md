# Scan Profiles

Scan profiles make the process of initiating a scan quicker, they allow you to use predefined scan settings when creating a new scan.

To see and edit your scan profiles, go to the "Scan Profiles" tab from your dashboard.

There are 3 default profiles:
- **Fast Scan** - Preconfigured optimized scan, the engine will determine automatically which tests to run, based on the data types that are detected. Some tests will be skipped in favour of speed.
- **Comprehensive Scan** - All the possible tests will be performed during the scan. This is the most thorough scan, which accordingly takes the longest time to finish
- **API Scanning** - Preconfigured tests that are relevant for API targets
