    Modules:
    <ol type="A"; style="margin-top:-18px;">
    <li>DAST - scan your application for OWASP Top 10 + vulnerabilities and many different CVEs.</li>
    <li>Fuzzer - scan your application for OWASP Top 10 + vulnerabilities, as well as business logic vulnerabilities, 0-Days and many unknown vulnerabilities. This module can be harmful to your system and so must be used only on a testing environment.</li>
    </ol>

    d
    <ol type="A"; style="margin-top:-18px;">
    <li>Recording - use a pre-recorded session of your application (a HAR or WSAR file) which was created either manually or automatically with QA tools such as Selenium to scan your application. With this discovery type you can define the scope of the scan and store login information to scan areas in your application which require authentication.</li>
    <li>Crawler - use our Crawler to scan your application or parts of it automatically. All you need is a URL.</li>
    <li>Open API - NexPloit supports scanning APIs. You’ll need a *.yml file.</li>
    </ol>

    Scan Profiles:
    <ul type=""; style="margin-top:-18px">
    <li>Scan profiles make the process of initiating a scan quicker, they allow you to use predefined scan settings when creating a new scan.</li>
    </ul>

4. Proceed according to your choice of Discovery Types (notice that you can combine <a href="#/user-guide/scans/new-scan?id=Discovery_Types" style="text-decoration: inherit; color: inherit; font: inherit">options A. and B.</a> in a single scan):

    ### Use a HAR/WSAR file
