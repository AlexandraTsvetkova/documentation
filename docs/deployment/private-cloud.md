## Overview
Unlike the standard SaaS offering, which uses a multi-tenant architecture for the databases, and static network configurations, the **Private Cloud** offer provides you with a completely separate, configurable, cloud environment for your organization.

!> The **Private Cloud** instance is still hosted on the neuraLegion infrastructure.

## How it Works
All the relevant components that may include sensitive information, such as Databases, Engines, etc., are deployed in a separate cloud instance, which is managed by NeuraLegion.

Currently the **Private Cloud** offer is deployed on **AWS**, but deployment to other cloud vendors can be added as needed.

## Benefits Over the Standard SaaS Offering
A completely separate environment (not multi-tenant), which includes:
- Separate Databases on the instance level, not just logical level on same Database like the standard SaaS offer
- Full control over network level configurations such as: 
  - Load handling
  - Network level access configurations (IP allow/deny)
  - Option for site2site VPN setup
- Improved security against lateral movement scenarios

## Deployment Options
Currently, deployment is possible on AWS, but deployment to other cloud vendors can be added if needed for specific scenarios. NeuraLegion fully manages the deployment process for you.

## FAQ
#### Will using a Private Cloud remove the need to use a Repeater? <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
If the reason for using the Repeater is only to control network flow, and a site2site VPN tunnel can be created which will allow full access from the private cloud into the organizationâ€™s network, then the repeater is not needed. Otherwise, the Repeater is still needed for secure access to a local target from the cloud.

#### Do I still need to use whitelisting in my Firewall if I have a Private Cloud? <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Yes, unless a Site2Site VPN is configured and used.

#### Can I use a private data center instead of a private cloud? <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
This is not an option we offer at this time.

#### Will NeuraLegion have access to my vulnerabilities that are found? <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Only if the owner of the organization will invite one of NeuraLegionâ€™s engineers to the organization for support needs. A NeuraLegion representative will never be able to access your scan results without your permission.
