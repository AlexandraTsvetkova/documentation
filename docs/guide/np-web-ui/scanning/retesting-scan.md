# Retesting a Scan
Retesting at issue creates a separate scan entity that is a duplicate of the selected scan. Initially, the settings are identical, but can be modified by you without affecting the original scan settings. A separate [Scan History](guide/np-web-ui/scanning/reviewing-scans.md#reviewing-scan-history) is maintained for this retested scan.

To retest an existing scan â€“
1. Select the **Scans** option in the left pane to display the Scans List. 
2. Click the **Status** column of the scan to be retested.\
