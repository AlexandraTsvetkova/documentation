# Adding Your Authentication Object to a Scan

When [starting a new scan](http://localhost:3000/#/guide/np-web-ui/scanning/creating-new-scan), you can select any of the authentication objects that you have created previously in NexPloit. This will allow the NexPloit Engine to perform the re-authentication automatically during the scan.

You can apply either the DAST or Fuzzer module, as well as all the discovery types for the scans with connected authentication objects. 

## Prerequisites

*   You are an active user on [nexploit.app](https://nexploit.app/scans).
*   You have a valid Authentication Object configured.

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. Go to the **SCAN SETUP** section.
2. From the **Authentication** dropdown list, select the required object.
