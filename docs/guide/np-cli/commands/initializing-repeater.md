# ðŸ”› Initializing a Repeater
```nexploit-cli repeater [options]``` initializes a local Repeater process. When a scan is connected to such a Repeater, all the scan requests are pulled from the cloud through the Repeater to the local target of the scan.

A Repeater enables you to run NexPloit scans on a local compiled application, without exposing your ports externally. This means that you can scan an application without having to deploy the application or to generate external reports.

For details about how the Repeater works, see [On-Prem Agent Repeater (Agent) Deployment](guide/introduction/deployment-options.md#on-premises-repeater-agent).

## Additional Features
* Enables multiple scans to run through a single Repeater.
* Option to add headers to requests locally (authentication cookie and so on), without exposing them to the cloud.

> [!WARNING|label:Important]
The Repeater requires a working `AUTH_TOKEN` with the scope repeaters:write.
