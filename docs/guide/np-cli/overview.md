# Overview
Nexploit CLI is a command line interface (CLI) tool for NeuraLegion solutions. Nexploit CLI provides full control over scans, including initializing, stopping, polling and maintaining scans and much more. Nexploit CLI can also serve as a Repeater for scanning local targets, without exposing them to the Internet.

The Nexploit CLI offers the following features –
* Supports the Nexploit API commands.
* Configurable using JSON, XML, YML and JS formats.
* Able to generate real interaction data (.har files) from mock interactions (unit tests).
* Can serve as a Repeater for communication from the cloud to a local target.
