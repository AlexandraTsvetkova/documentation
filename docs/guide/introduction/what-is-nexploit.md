# What is NexPloit?
NeuraLegion’s NexPloit is a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) solution powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and modern scanning technologies. With its effective automation and integration capabilities, NexPloit allows developers to scan multiple targets, uncover security vulnerabilities without false positives, get detailed reports on every finding,  and quickly fix security issues by following the remediation guidelines.  

NexPloit’s state of the art Artificial Intelligence Application Security Testing (AIAST®) technology can detect even complex issues that other solutions cannot uncover in modern applications.

NexPloit is built to solve the core security tasks of your applications and APIs:
* **Findings Vulnerabilities (Issues) –** As well as finding OWASP Top 10  technical issues (and much more) in your applications, NexPloit’s AI Engine automatically detects unknown Zero-Day and Business-Logic Flow issues, reducing lengthy and costly manual testing, as well as providing False Positive Free reporting and remediation guidelines. 

* **Security Testing Automation –** NexPloit enables seamless integration into your Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). As the only solution that has automated the Zero-day detection, our False Positive Free reports are generated in real-time, with pinpoint code instrumentation, empowering your DevOps to the highest security standards, without losing development speed or agility. 

* **Security Standard Compliance –** NexPloit provides you with a comprehensive scanning flow which simplifies your compliance validation process and provides instant reports of identified issues that accelerate your confirmation process. NexPloit enables you to firmly comply with the standards of OWASP Top 10 technical issues, ISO/IEC 27001, PCI DSS, CWE/SANS, and more.
