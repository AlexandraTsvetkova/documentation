# Data Security FAQs
## What kind of information does NeuraLegion access **during** a scan?
During a scan, NeuraLegion collects both application data and user data, which are used as part of the scan –
* Application Data – Refers to anything related to the application structure and functionality, such as parameter names and object structures. Collectively, this information is used to determine the application's attack surface.
* User Data – Refers to specific user information, such as parameter values or authentication data. This information is used to improve the scan quality and results, as well as to identify parameter types and automatically log in, as needed.

## What kind of information does NeuraLegion store **after** a scan?
NeuraLegion’s cloud machine learning engine does not store the customer’s user data after the scan. User data obtained during a scan is stored solely in memory and is deleted as the scan ends. Application data is stored anonymously after a scan in order to improve NeuraLegion’s machine learning engines.

In addition, NeuraLegion stores scan results after a scan. This data is not directly available  to NeuraLegion unless the customer shares it with NeuraLegion.

## How does NeuraLegion ensure data security and privacy?
Customer security and privacy are NeuraLegion’s top priority. NeuraLegion follows industry best-practices and standards to keep data as safe as possible. Our data storage protocols include encryption, access control, data segregation (a private separate instance for each scan per client) and more.

## Will NeuraLegion share the finding reports with anyone else?
No. Only the customer has access to their reports. Customers can choose to download reports or to use them within our system. Customers have complete control over access permissions to these reports.

Be aware that once scans are removed from the system, they are permanently deleted. This means that after scans are removed from the system, NeuraLegion has no access to them and cannot restore the deleted information.
