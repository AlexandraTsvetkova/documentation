# Using Nexploit – QuickStart
NexPloit provides the following options for interacting with its engine. All of these can be used for all types of [Nexploit deployments](guide/introduction/deployment-options.md).
* Nexploit Web User Interface
* Nexploit REST API
* Nexploit CLI
The following shows how easy it is to set up and start using Nexploit.

## QuickStart Setup
Setting up Nexploit is quite easy:
* **Nexploit Web User Interface –** No set up is required to use NexPloit’s web interface. Simply log in to the NeuraLegion platform from a standard web browser and select the target application to be scanned. 
* **Nexploit REST API / Nexploit CLI –** The only setup that is required is to generate an authentication token (also called an API key). See Managing Your Personal API Keys) for a full description. 
* **Integration –** Advanced set up and configuration options are not mandatory for using Nexploit, unless you want to integrate the vulnerabilities that Nexploit detects. Nexploit enables you to create a fully automated integrated CI/CD pipeline of its detected vulnerabilities (issues) into a variety of tools and platforms, such as Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), ticketing, bug tracking tools. See Integrating into Your Pipeline for a full description of the integration options.
