The following shows how easy it is to set up and start using NexPloit.

## QuickStart Setup
Setting up NexPloit is quite easy –
* **NexPloit Web User Interface –** No set up is required to use NexPloit’s web interface. Simply log in to the NeuraLegion platform from a standard web browser and select the target application to be scanned. 
* **NexPloit REST API / NexPloit CLI –** The only setup that is required is to generate an authentication token (also called an API key). See Managing Your Personal API Keys) for a full description. 
* **Integration –** Advanced set up and configuration options are not mandatory for using NexPloit, unless you want to integrate the vulnerabilities that NexPloit detects. NexPloit enables you to create a fully automated integrated CI/CD pipeline of its detected vulnerabilities (issues) into a variety of tools and platforms, such as Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), ticketing, bug tracking tools. See Integrating into Your Pipeline for a full description of the integration options.
