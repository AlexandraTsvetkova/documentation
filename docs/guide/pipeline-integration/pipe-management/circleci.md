# CircleCI – Pipe Management

![circleci-logo](media/circleci/circleci-logo.png ':size=20%')

To enable full automation to your CI/CD pipeline, you can configure NexPloit to automatically run a scan with every build. Each new build with CircleCI Orb performs security tests on the running application and provides all the information from NexPloit that developers need to solve problems, without having to leave their development environment.

More information about our CircleCI Orb can be found here – [circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/neuralegion/nexploit](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/neuralegion/nexploit).
