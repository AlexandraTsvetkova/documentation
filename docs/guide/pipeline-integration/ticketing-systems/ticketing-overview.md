# Ticketing Systems Integration
You can view and manage the NexPloit reports on every detected vulnerability in the ticketing and communication systems that you use in your development environment. The integration allows you to simplify and fasten the process of solving the security issues of your application or API by using the automatically created issue tickets and distributing the remediation tasks among your development team. You can configure the NexPloit integration with the following ticketing and communication systems: 
* [Jira](guide/pipeline-integration/ticketing-systems/integrating-with-nexploit/jira.md)
* [GitHub](guide/pipeline-integration/ticketing-systems/integrating-with-nexploit/github.md)
* [Slack](guide/pipeline-integration/ticketing-systems/integrating-with-nexploit/slack.md)
