# CircleCI Integration

## About
To enable full automation into your CI/CD pipeline, you can configure our solutions to automatically run a scan with every build. Each new build with our **CircleCI Orb** will perform security tests on the running application and provide all the information from NexPloit to give developers everything they need to solve the problems, without leaving the comfort of their development environment.

More information about our CircleCI Orb can be found here: https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/neuralegion/nexploit
